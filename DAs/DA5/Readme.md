#  Assigment 5 Mapping & Navigation - Angelo Nolasco
# Description of the problem and Solution
* The first goal is to create a map using the gmapping algorithm. I created a map of my kitchen, I used the keyboard to map the kitchen.
* The second goal was to use the map that was saved to localize it and then navigate. Before doing that I need to install some package. After that I opened the map that I saved and did the localization, then I navigated around my kitchen.
